**Some very important steps**

- Google Colaboratory for short Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) provides a free cloud service based on Jupyter Notebooks that support free GPU.

- Google Colabroatory's Jupyter Notebook environment does not require any setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud.

- Google Colaboratory can be used for executing the Lab's R Jupyter Notebooks (Quizzes and worksheets) and is integrated into your Laurier account.

- Use Laurier account and open Google Drive, create a folder named ST494_Lab. This folder would be used to hold your all Lab's worksheets and quizzes.

- Create a folder "Lab_X" in the ST494_Lab folder and upload the Worksheet_X.ipynb  (downloaded from MyLearningSpace page of ST494 lab).

- Right-click on the uploaded Worksheet_X.ipynb and open it with Google Colaboratory.  Please read and code as you progress in Jupyter notebook, also make sure that you save your notebook before exiting the browser.

- You can also directly open https://colab.research.google.com/ to upload the local file into Google Colaboratory environment

      > File menu -> click on Upload notebook 

- This would open your uploaded notebook directly without saving into Google Drive. But If you want to save it you can do from File menu options.

- ALWAYS BE SURE TO SAVE YOUR WORK AS YOUR PROGRESS THROUGH THESE LABS!
